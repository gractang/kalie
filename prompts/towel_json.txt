Describe the robot gripper's motion to hang the towel on the rack. This should be done by outputting a string of keypoints and waypoints based on the provided image of the current table-top environment captured from a top-down camera.

The definition of these keypoints and waypoints are:
- 'Grasp Point': The point on the towel where the robot gripper should hold.
- 'Function Point':  Same as the 'Grasp Point.'
- 'Target Point': The point on the towel rack that will be contacted by 'Function Point.'
- 'Pre-contact Point': The waypoint in the free space that the 'Function Point' moves to before making contact with the 'Target Point.'
- 'Post-contact Point': The waypoint in the free space that the 'Function Point' moves to after making contact with the 'Target Point.'

Please structure your response in the following format, where x and y are pixel coordinates:
"{\n    \"Grasp Point\": [\n        x,\n        y\n    ],\n    \"Function Point\": [\n        x,\n        y\n    ],\n    \"Target Point\": [\n        x,\n        y\n    ],\n    \"Pre-contact Point\": [\n        x,\n        y\n    ],\n    \"Post-contact Point\": [\n        x,\n        y\n    ]\n}"
